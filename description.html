			<p>This is a simple web programming project developed by a small team. With the use of OpenWeatherMap API,
			we send a request by entering a city, optionally followed by the U.S. state and country code that are
			separated by commas. For example, entering in <strong>Los Angeles</strong> in the search bar will provide details of said
			city. Typing in <strong>Los Angeles, California, US</strong> would also yield the same result.</p>
